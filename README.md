# NumPy Program: Column-wise Sorting of a 2D Array

## 🎯 Aim
To write a **NumPy** program that sorts the elements in each column of a given 2D array in ascending order.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Import NumPy**: Start by importing the NumPy library.
2. **Get Input**: Accept a 2D NumPy array from the user.
3. **Sort Column-wise**: Use the `np.sort()` function with `axis=0` to sort each column in ascending order.
4. **Store Result**: Store the sorted result in a new array.
5. **Display Output**: Print the original array and the column-wise sorted array.

## 🧾 Program
```
import numpy as np 

a=np.array(eval(input())) 

print("Given array") 

print(end=" ") 

print(a) 

print() 

print(np.sort(a,axis=0)) 
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the python program for sorting each column in numpy has been implemented and executed 
successfully.

# # NumPy Program: Find Indices Where Elements in Array x are Greater Than or Equal to Corresponding Elements in Array y

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program using **NumPy** that finds the indices where elements in array `x` are greater than or equal to their corresponding elements in array `y`.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. **Import NumPy**: Import the NumPy library.
2. **Define Arrays**: Define two NumPy arrays, `x` and `y`, with the same shape (i.e., same number of elements).
3. **Use Boolean Indexing**: 
   - `x > y` gives a boolean array where elements of `x` are greater than `y`.
   - `x == y` gives a boolean array where elements of `x` are equal to `y`.
4. **Find Indices**: Use `np.where()` to get the indices where the conditions `x >= y` are satisfied.
5. **Print Indices**: Print the indices where the condition holds true.

## 🧾 Program
```
import numpy as np 

x=eval(input()) 

y=eval(input()) 

l1=np.array(x) 

l2=np.array(y) 

print(np.where(l1>l2)) 

print(np.where(l1==l2))
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the python program for element wise comparison between two numpy array has been 
implemented and executed successfully.
